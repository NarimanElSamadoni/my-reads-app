# My Reads: A Book Tracking App
My Reads is a book tracking application where you can add books in one of three shelves; Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. You can also search for books using a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md) and add them into the desired shelf. Clicking on a Book title will display a page with the book details (Title, Subtitle, Authors, and description).
